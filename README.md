## Inspiration

With the use of technology being integrated into our everyday lives, there is an increasing number of children who use a smartphone regularly all around the world. We realize that children can be vulnerable to the range of negative experiences on the Internet. This led to the creation of Eric The Balloon.

## What it does

Caring parents can install Eric on their children's smartphone and our product will be seamlessly integrated into any modern Android device. It works in the background and doesn't disturb the kid, but if it detects some special activities like receiving messages from scammers or bullies, it instantly notifies the child with the appropriate advice. We believe that awareness of the kid is better than any intrusive blocking of the threats. That's why we focus on teaching a kid by giving him a choice and a possible solution.

## How we built it

We've built it with the latest Android Development Tools: Android Studio & Kotlin. There are a few libraries we've been using - FloatingAndroidView, Calligraphy, and Lottie. We've used the Lottie for our custom Adobe After Effects animations to import the character into the project. Also, we've used the Jaro Distance Algorithm to find similar phrases for specific events.

## Challenges we ran into

Unconventional development for Android can be a challenging task. The Android Accessibility Service, Lottie Animations and Overlay API are complex and tedious. Moreover, they require a ton of persistence and dedication. The most complicated thing was to make the Accessibility Service work and to parse the view data from it. Also, we were making the original character - Eric, which required custom illustrations and animations to be done in the Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects respectively. That was a verbose and time-consuming process, but we have managed to get it done.

## Accomplishments that we're proud & what's next for Eric

We were inspired to make the breathtaking prototype of the personal helper for children by the current technology demands. Eric has great potential to be the Alpha-generation guardian from the wild and dangerous Internet world. We are proud of what we've created so far, and we're looking forward to what we can do with it. We are sure - it has an immense capability to be an innovation that a secure future is waiting for.
