# Eric the Floating Balloon

## Inspiration

Every year, more and more children receive cell phones in their early age and start using the Internet, which is not a safe place for them. We're trying to improve their safety and make their parents calmer.

As you can see, children are exposed to bullying, phishing and more on the Internet.

### How are kids getting online?

According to the “Children’s Internet Usage Study” above, 70% of kids in grades 4-8 have a cellphone, 64% have a tablet, and 48% have a computer in their bedroom. So our tiny humans have quite a few opportunities to go online without adult supervision.

## What it does

Eric helps to recognize dangerous situations in the Internet by checking what is showing currently on the screen and informs the user, in our case the kid, about it. Also it can inform parent/legal guardian about this danger.

## How we built it

We used Android's Accessibility Service, mostly made for people with disabilities to allow Eric to see what's happening on the screen in real time, without sending the data to any outside servers.

## Challenges we ran into

It was really hard to recognize pedophile but we used so many ifs and elses that we can do it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Parents can now be more calm because they're kids are under Eric protection

## What we learned

The safety of children is so important because they are the most common social group that is falling victim to cyberbullying, phishing etc.

## What's next for Eric
